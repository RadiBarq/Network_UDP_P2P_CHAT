<h2>About The Project</h2>
<p>This is project created for the Network 1 class at my university so that it's a simple peer to peer chat using UDP protocol
notice that it's only for 2 users The goal of developing this project is to prove the implementation of UDP protocol. Notice
also additional code written for both sides to guarantee that the message is received by the receiver before displaying it in
the sender side.
